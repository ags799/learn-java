We learn Java by implementing answers to common interview questions.

## Development

Prepare your environment by

- installing [serverless](http://serverless.com)
- setting AWS access key ID & secret access key values

Verify your code with

    ./gradlew check

Deploy your code with

    ./gradlew deploy

The output of the deploy command will indicate the URL to which the code was deployed.
